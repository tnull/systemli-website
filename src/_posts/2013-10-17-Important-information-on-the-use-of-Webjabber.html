excerpt: We use the software <a href="http://jappix.org" target="_blank">Jappix</a>. for the Webjabber. This software normally stores various data like conversations in the local part of your browser. This feature is not necessary but actually quite dangerous in case you use a computer that is not encrypted. This is why we have altered this feature of the software to that effect that no data is stored in your browser. For the sake of transparency we provide you with the opportunity to check for yourself if there is any data of the Webjabber stored in your browser and to delete them if necessary.
