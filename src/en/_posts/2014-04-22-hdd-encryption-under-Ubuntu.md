End of last year it became known that there had been a successful attack against the hard drive-encryption of many Linux systems. The widely used Linux-distribution Ubuntu was affected as well. A few days ago Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been released which is immune against these attacks and will be maintained for 5 years. 

A simple upgrade of the distribution is not able to close the attack vector. Therefore we encourage you to treat your computer to a completely new installation. Encrypting the hard drive with Ubuntu completely needs only one click and immensely improves your security against physical attacks.en wir dazu, euer Betriebssystem komplett neu zu installieren. Die komplette Festplatte zu verschlüsseln, benötigt in Ubuntu nur einen Klick und steigert eure Sicherheit gegenüber physischen Angriffen enorm.
