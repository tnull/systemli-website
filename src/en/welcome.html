<p>In the following, we would like to introduce ourselves and give you a few hints how to use our services.</p>

<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>We are a non-commercial techie-collective. We believe that everyone should be able to benefit from new technological innovations; independent of income and standard of knowledge and without compromising one's own privacy. Read more in the section <a href="en/about-us.html">about us</a>.</p>

<h3>Information about systemli.org</h3>
<p>On <a href="https://systemli.org">our website</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/systemli target="_blank" ><img src="/assets/img/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" class="twitter" /> @systemli</a> we provide information about problems, planned maintenance works, changes in certificates and new services. From time to time we point out events or interesting articles about topics like network policy and computer safety. To be well informed, you should check our news regularly. If one of our services is not available, you can check there if we are already busy with fixing the problem.</p>
<p>On our website you can also find an overview of the <a href="/en/service/index.html">services we offer</a>.</p>

<h3>Using Jabber</h3>
<p>When using jabber.systemli.org, you need to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>please follow our <a href="https://wiki.systemli.org/howto/jabber_eng">instructions</a></li>
    <li>the content of group chats has only a limited life-span</li>
    <li>use additional encryption (<a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/">OTR </a>or gpg)</li>
    <li><a href="https://wiki.systemli.org/howto/jabber_eng">disable logging</a></li>
    <li> support your friends in disabling logging and using additional encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment there exists no Jabber-server-software that <a href="/en/2014/05/14/Background-datatransfer-and-groupchat.html">would make it possible to preserve group chats after rebooting.</a> In the case of maintenance works we can unfortunately not take the content of chats into account.</p>
<p>In such case it's not possible for us to let you know in advance in order to save these contents. Please consider this and regard the content of group chats as ephemeral. </p>

<h3>Passwords</h3>
<p>As generally in the internet, also with us you should use a <b>strong password</b>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>more than 12 digits</li>
    <li>it should contain numerics and special characters</li>
    <li>should not be a word found in a dictionary</li>
    <li>should only be used once</li>
    <li>should be changed once a year</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you might have many different passwords and none of them used twice, we recommend the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">passwordmanager</a>.</p>

<h3>Donations</h3>
<p>
We put a lot of work and money in providing our services. All running costs are covered through <a href="/en/spenden.html">donations</a>. If you have the possibility, please donate some money to us.</p>
